## Dataset
Dataset used for this research project is the clean `12-month Ocean Carbon States (OCS)` dataset, which can be found in the data folder.

Further information: https://data.giss.nasa.gov/oceans/carbonstates/

## Research Questions

1. Can we explore other pattern recognition techniques for classifying ocean carbon regimes based on geophysical data such as pCO2 and SST? (ie. different types of clustering)

2. Can we cluster regimes using more than two variables, ie. pCO2, SST, and `x variable`?

## Conclusion


## Progress

1. Worked on an existing project on climatology data to study Translated scripts  Matlab to Python codes
